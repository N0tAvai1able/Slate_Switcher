# Slate_Switcher
A simple and lightweight vibe coded program made to cover for the removal of a simple yet really useful quick setting in Windows.

The Simple Program when run asks for administrator privileges and then simply stays in the system tray on the taskbar ready to be clicked on to switch between "Touch Mode" and "Pc Mode".
With the introduction of Windows 11, Microsoft decided to remove the handy little button that used to reside inside the Windows 10 "quick settings" and bury the setting deep inside the new cluttered settings app. Moreover now the only way to switch between the modes is either to take off your keyboard (in a tablet like surface pro) or rotate your laptop beyond 200°.

## Left Click on tray icon:
When clicked it instantly switches the windows environment between Touch and Pc mode.

## Right Click on tray icon:
It opens up a handy little menu which contains some simple controls such as to quickly change the orientation of the screen, or to close the program.

<sub>I have on my pc set this program to run on startup by putting the shortcut for it into the startup folder (accessible by going into win+r and typing <ins>shell:startup<ins/>)<sub/>
